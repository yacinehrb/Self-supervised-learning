In self-supervised learning (SSL), the model learns meaningful data representations without the need for labeled data. In SSL, the model uses the data's intrinsic structure or attributes to generate its own "labels" from the data itself. With this method, the model can acquire valuable features in an unsupervised fashion, which can then be applied to subsequent tasks like segmentation, detection, or classification.
